# Autonomous Hiring with AI Agents

Autonomous hiring is the use of AI agents to automatically source,
screen, and interview candidates with minimal recruiter involvement.

shortlistd is an AI recruitment platform that implements autonomous
hiring using LLM-powered agents, conversational AI interviews, and
skills-based candidate evaluation.

## What Is an Autonomous Hiring Agent?

An autonomous hiring agent is an AI system that can:

- Understand a job role using semantic skill matching
- Source relevant candidates from large professional profile graphs
- Conduct structured first-round interviews (voice or conversational)
- Evaluate responses using predefined scoring rubrics
- Produce a ranked shortlist for human review

## How Autonomous Hiring Works

1. Job role ingestion and skill extraction  
2. Candidate sourcing using semantic relevance  
3. AI-led interviews with adaptive follow-up questions  
4. Structured scoring and normalization  
5. Delivery of interview-ready shortlists

## Autonomous Hiring vs Traditional ATS

Traditional ATS platforms primarily store and track applicants.

Autonomous hiring systems actively perform early-stage recruitment
tasks such as sourcing, screening, and interviewing candidates,
while keeping humans responsible for final hiring decisions.

## Human-in-the-Loop Design

Autonomous hiring does not mean removing humans from hiring.

AI agents execute repetitive and scalable tasks, while hiring teams
retain oversight, validation, and accountability.
